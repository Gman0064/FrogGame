# FroggoBongo

 A small game about a frog that jumps through the swamp using bongos.


This is a game built for the [2022 Auburn TigerDev Input Hardware Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/tigerdev-hardware-peripheral-) between Febraury 20th through the 27th (1 week). This game was designed to utilize the [Donkey Konga Bongos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_Kong_Jungle_Beat#Development) for the Nintendo Gamecube as an input device. This game also supports arrow keys for input.


All code and art was created by myself. Background music was used with permission from Kevin Macleod. Sound effects were found from various users from freesound.org
